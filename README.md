> **"Transform Chaos into GPA."**

**SmartStudy Agent** is an enterprise-grade Multi-Agent System (MAS) designed to democratize elite-level academic coaching. By orchestrating a fleet of 6 specialized AI agents, it transforms raw, disorganized study materials (PDFs, PPTXs, Notes) into highly structured, actionable, and exam-focused learning roadmaps.

Powered by **CrewAI** and **Google Gemini** (Optimized for `flash-lite` efficiency), the system simulates a team of human experts—from a Professor summarizing notes to a Strategist planning your week—working in unison to guarantee your academic success.

## 🧠 System Architecture: Deep Dive

SmartStudy Agent is not just a chatbot wrapper; it is an orchestrated **Multi-Agent System (MAS)** that mimics a human study group.

### 🔄 The Logic Behind the Scenes

1.  **Strict Sequential Delegation**:
    *   Unlike chatty LLMs, agents here don't talk over each other.
    *   **Step 1**: `Summarizer` reads your 50-page PDF and compresses it to the "Golden Truth".
    *   **Step 2**: `Scheduler` takes that "Golden Truth" and time-blocks it. Without Step 1, Step 2 fails.
    *   **Step 3**: `QuizGenerator` looks at the "Golden Truth" to find weak spots.
    *   *Result*: Coherent, dependency-aware outputs.

2.  **State Management & Memory**:
    *   The backend (`backend/src/memory.py`) maintains a `SessionState`.
    *   As agents finish tasks, their outputs are stored in `state['context']`.
    *   The `StudyCoordinator` reads this final state to compile the report.

3.  **Real-Time Data Flow (SSE)**:
    *   **Backend**: `main.py` uses `queue.Queue` to capture `stdout` (print statements) from the CrewAI process.
    *   **Streamer**: A persistent `async` generator yields these logs to the frontend via `/generate-plan`.
    *   **Frontend**: `app.js` reads this stream chunk-by-chunk, updating the "Matrix-style" log in real-time.

4.  **Quota-Safe Engineering**:
    *   To allow this to run on **Free Tier** APIs, we stagger agent execution.
    *   We use `gemini-flash-lite` (low cost/high speed) for the heavy lifting (reading PDFs).
    *   We use `gemini-flash` (high reasoning) only for the final synthesis.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
-   **Python 3.10** or higher.
-   A **Google Gemini API Key** (Get it free at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com)).

### 1. Environment Setup

Clone the repository and navigate to the backend:

```bash
cd smart_study_agent/backend
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages, including CrewAI, FastAPI, and document parsers:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory with your API key:

```ini
# backend/.env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSy...YourKeyHere
CREWAI_TRACING_ENABLED=false
OUTPUT_DIR=./outputs
```

### 4. Running the Application

**Start the Backend Server:**

```bash
# In backend/ directory with venv activated:
python main.py
```
*You will see: `Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8081`*

**Launch the Frontend:**
Simply open the `frontend/index.html` file in your preferred web browser (Chrome/Edge recommended).
*   Right-click `index.html` -> Open with -> Google Chrome.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting & FAQ

**Q: I see "429 Resource Exhausted" errors.**
*   **A**: You are hitting the Gemini Free Tier limit (15 requests/minute). The system has built-in rate limits (`max_rpm`), but if you trigger it, simply wait 60 seconds and try again.

**Q: The result boxes are empty?**
*   **A**: This usually means the backend crashed or the API key is invalid. Check the terminal where `main.py` is running for error logs.

**Q: Can I use GPT-4 instead?**
*   **A**: Yes. Update `backend/src/agents.py` to use `ChatOpenAI` and set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your `.env`.

**Q: My PDF text isn't extracting.**
*   **A**: Ensure the PDF is text-selectable (OCR applied). Scanned images cannot be read by `pypdf` without Tesseract (not included to keep dependencies light).
